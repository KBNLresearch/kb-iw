# JP2 Batch Converter

## About this software

Jp2batchconverter converts image files in digitisation batches to JP2 (JPEG 2000 Part 1) format using the [Grok](https://github.com/GrokImageCompression/grok) codec. It clones the structure of the input directory, and then replicates it in the output directory. The JP2 images are then subjected to the following quality checks:

1. Pixel comparison between each pair of source and destination images (using [libvips](https://www.libvips.org/) and [pyvips](https://libvips.github.io/pyvips/)).
2. Check of extracted technical properties (using [jpylyzer](https://jpylyzer.openpreservation.org/)) against a user-defined [Schematron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schematron) profile.

The software also generates checksums of all converted images.

## Dependencies

- Python (tested with version 3.12)
- [Grok JPEG 2000 codec](https://github.com/GrokImageCompression/grok) (tested with version ??)

- [Libvips](https://www.libvips.org/)

## Installation of dependencies

### Grok

Download the latest binaries of the Grok image compression software for your platform:

<https://github.com/GrokImageCompression/grok/releases>

To install, just extract the ZIP file to your local file system.

### Libvips

On Linux (Ubuntu, Linux Mint), install libvips using:

```
sudo apt install libvips-dev --no-install-recommends
```

For installation on other platforms, see [instructions here](https://www.libvips.org/install.html), and also [here](https://pypi.org/project/pyvips/).

<!--

Pyvips docs (<https://libvips.github.io/pyvips/README.html>) mention 2 installation types:

- binary (no need to install libvips separately)
- local (needs separate libvips install)

Tried binary install:

```
pip install "pyvips[binary]"
```

This works, but doesn't recognise JP2! So it seems we need a local install instead, using:

```
sudo apt install libvips-dev --no-install-recommends
pip install pyvips

```

BUT even after uninstalling "pyvips[binary]" first, pyvips ended up not recognising JP2 images (apparently it remained stuck in cffi API mode).
I was only able to fix this by deleting my Python venv and creating a new one (and then installing pyvips).

## Imported Python packages

- lxml
- pyvips
- jpylyzer

TODO: add to setup.py, or better a [pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/) file

As of 2025, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) appears to be the most straightforward tool for installing Python applications on a variety of platforms (Linux, MacOS, Windows).

### uv installation

First, check if uv is installed on your system by typing the uv command in a terminal:

```
uv
```

If this results in a help message, uv is installed, and you can skip directly to the "imgquad installation" section below. If not, you first need to install uv.

On Linux and MacOS you can install uv with the following command:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, you can use wget if your system doesn't have curl installed:

```
wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

To install uv on Windows, open a Powershell terminal, and run the following command:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Regardless of the operating system, in some cases the installation script will update your system's configuration to make the location of the uv executable globally accessible. If this happens, just close your current terminal, and open a new one for these changes to take effect. Pay attention to the screen output of the installation script for any details on this.

### imgquad installation

Use the following command to install imgquad (all platforms):

```
uv tool install imgquad
```

Then run imgquad once:

```
imgquad
```

Depending on your system, imgquad will create a folder named *imgquad* in one of the following locations: 

- For Linux and MacOS, it will use the location defined by environment variable *$XDG_CONFIG_HOME*. If this variable is not set, it will use the *.config* directory in the user's home folder (e.g. `/home/johan/.config/imgquad`). Note that the *.config* directory is hidden by default.
- For Windows, it will use the *AppData\Local* folder (e.g. `C:\Users\johan\AppData\Local\imgquad`).

The folder contains two subdirectories named *profiles* and *schemas*, which are explained in the "Profiles" and "Schemas" sections below.

### upgrade imgquad

Use the following command to upgrade an existing imgquad installation to the latest version:

```
uv tool upgrade imgquad
```

## Command-line syntax

The general syntax of imgquad is:

```
usage: imgquad [-h] [--version] {process,list,copyps} ...
```

Imgquad has three sub-commands:

|Command|Description|
|:-----|:--|
|process|Process a batch.|
|list|List available profiles and schemas.|
|copyps|Copy default profiles and schemas to user directory.|

### process command

Run imgquad with the *process* command to process a batch. The syntax is:

```
usage: imgquad process [-h] [--prefixout PREFIXOUT] [--outdir OUTDIR]
                       [--delimiter DELIMITER] [--verbose]
                       profile batchDir
```

The *process* command expects the following positional arguments: 

|Argument|Description|
|:-----|:--|
|profile|This defines the validation profile. Note that any file paths entered here will be ignored, as Imgquad only accepts  profiles from the profiles directory. You can just enter the file name without the path. Use the *list* command to list all available profiles.|
|batchDir|This defines the batch directory that will be analyzed.|

In addition, the following optional arguments are available:

|Argument|Description|
|:-----|:--|
|--prefixout, -p|This defines a text prefix on which the names of the output files are based (default: "pq").|
|--outdir, -o|This defines the directory where output is written (default: current working directory from which imgquad is launched).|
|--delimiter, -d|This defines the delimiter that is used in the output summary file (default: ';')|
|--verbose, -b|This tells imgquad to report Schematron output in verbose format.|

In the simplest case, we can call imgquad with the profile and the batch directory as the only arguments:

```
imgquad process beeldstudio-retro.xml ./mybatch
```

Imgquad will now recursively traverse all directories and files inside the "mybatch" directory, and analyse all image files (based on a file extension match).

### list command

Run imgquad with the *list* command to get a list of the available profiles and schemas, as well as their locations. For example:

```
imgquad list
```

Results in:

```
Available profiles (directory /home/johan/.config/imgquad/profiles):
  - mh-2025-tiff.xml
Available schemas (directory /home/johan/.config/imgquad/schemas):
  - mh-2025-tiff-600.sch
```

### copyps command

If you run imgquad with the *copyps* command, it will copy the default profiles and schemas that are included in the installation over to your user directory.

**Warning:** any changes you made to the default profiles or schemas will be lost after this operation, so proceed with caution! If you want to keep any of these files, just make a copy and save them under a different name before running the *copyps* command.

## Profiles

A profile is an XML file that defines how a digitisation batch is evaluated. Here's an example:

```xml

```

The profile is made up of the following components:

1. One or more *extension* elements, which tell imgquad what file extensions to look for. Imgquad handles file extensions in a case-insensitive way, so *tif* covers both "rubbish.tif" and "rubbish.TIF".
2. Zero or more *ns* elements, each of which maps a namespace prefix to its corresponding uri.
3. One or more *summaryProperty* elements, which define the properties that are written to the summary file. Each summary property is expressed as an xpath expression. 
4. One or more *schema* elements, that each link a file or directory naming pattern to a Schematron file (explained in the next section).

In the example, there's only one  *schema* element, which is used for all processed images. Optionally, each *schema* element may contain *type*, *match* and *pattern* attributes, which define how a schema is linked to file or directory names inside the batch:

- If **type** is "fileName", the matching is based on the naming of an image. In case of "parentDirName" the matching uses the naming of the direct parent directory of an image.
- The **match** attribute defines whether the matching pattern with the file or directory name is exact ("is") or partial ("startswith", "endswith", "contains".)
- The **pattern** attribute defines a text string that is used for the match.

See the [pdfquad documentation](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/pdfquad#profiles) for an example of how these attributes are used.

### Available profiles

Currently the following profiles are included:

|Profile|Description|
|:--|:--|
|mh-2025-tiff.xml|Profile for digitised medieval manuscripts.|

## Schemas

Schemas contain the Schematron rules on which the quality assessment is based. Some background information about this type of rule-based validation can be found in [this blog post](https://www.bitsgalore.org/2012/09/04/automated-assessment-jp2-against-technical-profile). Currently the following schemas are included:

### mh-2025-tiff-600.sch

This is a schema for digitised medieval manuscripts. It includes the following checks:

|Check|Value|
|:---|:---|
|Image format|TIFF|
|ICC profile name|eciRGB v2|
|XResolution TIFF tag|tag exists|
|YResolution TIFF tag|tag exists|
|XResolution value|600 (+/- 1) |
|YResolution value|600 (+/- 1) |
|ResolutionUnit TIFF tag|tag exists|
|ResolutionUnit value|2 (inches)|
|ImageWidth TIFF tag|tag exists|
|ImageLength TIFF tag|tag exists|
|BitsPerSample TIFF tag|tag exists|
|BitsPerSample value|'8 8 8'|
|ICCProfile TIFF tag|tag exists|
|Copyright TIFF tag|tag exists|
|NewSubfileType TIFF tag|at most 1 instance of this tag|

|ISOSpeedRatings EXIF tag|tag exists|
|ISOSpeedRatings value|not empty|
|photoshop:Headline|defined in XMP metadata as either element `rdf:RDF/rdf:Description/photoshop:Headline`, or attribute `rdf:RDF/rdf:Description/@photoshop:Headline`|
|photoshop:Headline value|not empty|
|photoshop:Credit|defined in XMP metadata as either element `rdf:RDF/rdf:Description/photoshop:Credit`, or attribute `rdf:RDF/rdf:Description/@photoshop:Credit`|
|photoshop:Credit value|not empty|

The schema also includes an additional check on any exceptions that occurred while parsing the image, as this may indicate a corrupted file.

### mh-2025-tiff-300.sch

This schema is identical to the mh-2025-tiff-600.sch schema, except for the checks on the XResolution and YResolution values:

|Check|Value|
|:---|:---|
|XResolution value|300 (+/- 1) |
|YResolution value|300 (+/- 1) |

## Output

Imgquad reports the following output:

### Comprehensive output file (XML)

For each batch, Imgquad generates one comprehensive output file in XML format. This file contains, for each image, all extracted properties, as well as the Schematron report and the assessment status.

### Summary file (CSV)

This is a comma-delimited text file that summarises the analysis. At the minimum, Imgquad reports the following columns for each image:

|Column|Description|
|:-----|:--|
|file|Full path to the image file.|
|validationSuccess|Flag with value *True* if Schematron validation was succesful, and *False* if not. A value *False* indicates that the file could not be validated (e.g. because no matching schema was found, or the validation resulted in an unexpected exception)|
|validationOutcome|The outcome of the Schematron validation/assessment. Value is *Pass* if file passed all tests, and *Fail* otherwise. Note that it is automatically set to *Fail* if the Schematron validation was unsuccessful (i.e. "validationSuccess" is *False*)|
|validationErrors|List of validation errors (separated by "\|" characters).|

In addition, the summary file contains additional columns with the properties that are defined by the *summaryProperty* elements in the profile.
